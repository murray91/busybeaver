# Change settings in this file to setup and configure the post processing
#
# Explanation:
#   - First section is labelled setup. Changes here apply to all models processed.
#   - The script expects that every section after 'setup' is a model to be post processed.
#   - Copy and paste template of model section to add new models for post processing
#   - The script creates one GDB for each model section setup in this file
